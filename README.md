Recommendations:

1. Considering that male students had more cases of depression, it is therefore recommended that the student guidance and counselling unit look into this and engage the students in this particular subject matter. 
2. From observation, there seems to be no clear-cut difference in the mental illness status of the students, so it is recommended that they all be attended to with no separation or special attention based on history.
3. Observation showed that students between 18-27 were at greater risk than the elderly ones, so it there recommended that measures adopted by the elderly that led to a reduction in cases be taught to the younger students and possibly bring the elderly in for mentorship.
It is also recommended that students be enrolled on courses that will put less pressure on them, which can lead to depression
4. Good dietary intake plays a better role in student mental health cases, so, recommendation is that the student be taught the importance of taking a balanced diet and, where possible, design a diet plan and put in place measures to ensure strict compliance.
5. Generally observed was that students are more prone to depression, and irrespective of their department, the students would have a chance of going into depression, so it is recommended that the management of the schools place a proper guide for student study plans.
6. It was observed that academic pressure had a huge influence on the depression episodes as such, it is recommended that academic activity be well spaced with proper resting time, reduce sessional workload, avoid rush and students should be advised to avoid cramming projects.
7. Work pressure had not much pressure on the student. it is recommended that the measures in place for this be further checked to ensure that even the 0.01% cases are further wiped out.

Conclusion:
Depression among students should be considered a burning issue by the stakeholders, as males’ gender had more cases of depression, 55.72%, and there was no clarity between students with a family history of depression and those without. Also uncovered was that students' diet matters to their mental as 10317 students having an unhealthy diet had depression, which therefore means that more students may not have participated in the survey, none heard it, might even be more. Urgent steps should be taken to contain this menace among students. The student's medication history wasn’t given, and the year was also not given, so future research should focus on these areas.
